  /// in the entire widget tree, and therefore all owners should be treated as the same
  /// owner.
  ///
  /// The value for [role] can be anything a developer wants. The only thing that matter is
  /// its uniqueness as compared to other input [role]s in the same app and same widget tree.
  ///
  /// ### How `role` works
  /// The [role] is critical for dealing with `State` disposal and recreation when a
  /// widget tree changes an ancestor, and therefore recreates the entire subtree.
  ///
  /// For example, imagine a widget tree like this:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// SuperEditor(
  ///   //...
  /// )
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Then, something causes the widget tree to add a `SizedBox` above the `SuperEditor`:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// SizedBox(
  ///   child: SuperEditor(
  ///     //...
  ///   ),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This change causes the `SuperEditor` and all of its internal widgets to be disposed
  /// and recreated. More specifically, for each widget in the subtree, a new widget is
  /// initialized, and the previous widget is then disposed.
  ///
  /// But these widgets don't have any idea that they're being replaced - as far as they know
  /// they're being permanently destroyed. So should `SuperEditor`'s IME connection be closed
  /// or not?
  ///
  /// This [role] is an ID that binds together the previous `SuperEditor` that's disposed
  /// with the new `SuperEditor` that's being created. It tells the disposing `SuperEditor`
  /// NOT to close its IME connection, so that the new `SuperEditor` can continue to use it.
  /// This sharing prevents unexpected raising of the software keyboard across subtree
  /// recreations.
  final String? role;

  /// The specific owner of the IME, even within the same [role].
  ///
  /// The purpose of [instance] is to differentiate between initializing widgets and
  /// disposing widgets for the same input. See [role] for more info.
  ///
  /// A typical choice to provide as the [instance] is the [State] object that
  /// owns a given IME connection. This is a naturally effective choice because the
  /// concept of the [instance] is typically used to differentiate between initializing
  /// and disposing [State] objects for the same widget.
