# Rich Text Editor for Flutter

## Spikes

Develop spikes within the `/example` project. Include a new entrypoint for each
spike so that the standard demo continues to work.

Each spike should include internal comment documentation about which questions
the spike attempts to answer and what conclusions the spike demonstrates.
